# Senior Isolation Report

This repository for my report _Senior Isolation in the Era of COVID-19: How Project Blue Star is Taking an Evidence-Based Approach to Help_. You can find the report [HERE](https://medium.com/@fyzeen/senior-isolation-and-ageism-in-the-era-of-covid-19-how-a-central-minnesota-organization-is-taking-dd1ce878d802). The raw data is stored in the 'Data' Folder. The final plot images are stored in the 'Plot Images' folder. 'senior-isolation.ipynb' is the Jupyter Notebook which contains all the python code I used to analyze the data and render the plots. I primarily used Python Pandas and Matplotlib in this project.
